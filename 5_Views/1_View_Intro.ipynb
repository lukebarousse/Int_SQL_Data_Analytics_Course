    "  - Simplifies complex queries by storing them as reusable, named objects.  \n",
    "  - Ensures consistency and readability when multiple queries rely on the same logic.  \n",
    "  - Enhances security by restricting access to specific rows/columns.  \n",
    "  - Improves maintainability by centralizing changes to the query logic.\n",

    "    FROM table_name\n",
    "    WHERE condition;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - `CREATE VIEW view_name AS`: Creates a new view with the specified name.\n",
