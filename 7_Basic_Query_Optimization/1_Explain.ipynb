    "\n",
    "- **EXPLAIN**: Displays the execution plan of a SQL query, showing how PostgreSQL will execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syntax:  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  EXPLAIN SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`**: Executes the query and provides actual execution times, row estimates, and other runtime details.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps with query optimization by showing:\n",
    "  - Index usage\n",
    "  - Join methods (`Nested Loop`, `Hash Join`, `Merge Join`)\n",
    "  - Sequential vs. index scans\n",
    "  - Estimated vs. actual row counts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example Output** (simplified):\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..18.50 rows=850 width=64)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  - `Seq Scan`: PostgreSQL is doing a sequential scan (no index used).\n",
    "  - `cost`: Estimated startup and total cost.\n",
    "  - `rows`: Estimated number of rows.\n",
    "  - `width`: Estimated row size in bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Cases**:\n",
    "  - Debugging slow queries\n",
    "  - Checking if indexes are being used\n",
    "  - Understanding query performance bottlenecks\n",
    "\n",
    "### üíª¬†Final Result\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how PostgreSQL plans to execute the query without running it, helping identify potential inefficiencies like sequential scans or costly joins.\n",
    "- Execute the query while collecting actual performance metrics, allowing comparison between estimated and real execution times to optimize query performance.\n",
