    "- Use `INNER JOIN` instead of `LEFT JOIN` when unmatched rows aren‚Äôt needed.  \n",
    "- Filter early using `WHERE`, not `HAVING`, to reduce processed rows.  \n",
    "- Avoid `SELECT *`, select only required columns.  \n",
    "- Use `UNION` instead of `UNION ALL` when removing duplicates is acceptable.  \n",
    "- Pre-filter data before `GROUP BY` and `DISTINCT` to avoid unnecessary calculations.  \n",
    "- Replace `OR` conditions with `IN` for better index usage.  \n",
    "- Use `EXISTS` instead of `IN` for subqueries on large datasets.  \n",
    "- Ensure data types match in comparisons to prevent slow implicit conversions.  \n",
